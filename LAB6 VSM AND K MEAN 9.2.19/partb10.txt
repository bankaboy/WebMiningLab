The government has followed up its decision to discontinue older high-denominations currency notes with a strong push towards fostering a digital payments ecosystem. A committee of secretaries led by Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant was instructed to come up with the tools that could be used to make financial transactions without the involvement of cash. While most of these tools were already rolled out previously, banks and other financial services firms have started prioritising their expansion. These tools are meant to facilitate transactions not only for the payee, but also for merchants â€” both small and big. Small merchants and businessmen involved in the informal sector were pegged to be the worst hit, but the committee of secretaries, which also comprises IT ministry secretary Aruna Sundararajan and the CEO of Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) Ajay Bhushan Pandey, has identified tools that could bring anybody with a bank account on board for cashless payments. According to data provided by the Reserve Bank of India, there were around 75 crore debit and credit cards in the country, and almost 72 crore of these are debit cards. A senior government official said that most of these debit cards are used for the purpose of withdrawing money from ATMs. Most basic payments can be made via debit and credit cards to merchants that have a Point of Sale (PoS) machine. A merchant can acquire a PoS machine from a bank in which he or she holds an account. Banks provide a PoS terminal free of cost to their account holders, but they charge a merchant discount rate (MDR) as prescribed by the RBI. Different lenders have different eligibility criteria for deciding whether a terminal should be provided to a merchant or not. For example, the Union Bank has prescribed that the turnover of the merchant through cards should be over Rs 50,000 per month.
